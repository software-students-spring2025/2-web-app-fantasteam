3. As a user, I want to edit a task so that I can update its details if needed.
4. As a user, I want to delete a task so that I can remove completed or unnecessary tasks.
5. As a user, I want to search for tasks so that I can quickly find specific items.
6. As a user, I want to see only my completed tasks so that I can review what I have accomplished.
7. As a user, I want to mark a task as completed so that I can keep track of finished work.
8. As a user, I want to log in so that only I can manage my tasks.
9. As a user, I want to log out so that my tasks remain secure.
